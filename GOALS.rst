Goals for ``lectionarium``
======================================================================

In the **long-term**, I want to put the lectionary of the Ordinary
Form on the Internet in Latin.

In the **meantime**, I'd be ecstatic if I could say:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ lectionarium.py

...and today's readings would come out.

To achieve that, I hope to model the lectionary of the Ordinary Form
with human-readable scripture citations (like ``is 2:1-5``) and then
use them to retrieve the corresponding text(s).
