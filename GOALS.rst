* `Next Steps`_

Long-Term Goal
======================================================================

In the long-term, I want to put the lectionary of the Ordinary Form on
the Internet in Latin and do interesting things with it.

Short-Term Goal
======================================================================

Achieved: ``lectionary.sh`` and ``bible.sh`` can be used to print
readings and passages.

Present Status
======================================================================

With the short-term goal achieved, it's time to look at putting this
content onto the web.

Next Steps
======================================================================

I think being able to generate a static HTML trees to correspond with
``lectionary.sh`` and ``bible.sh`` is a next logical step.
