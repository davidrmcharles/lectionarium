Long-Term Goal
======================================================================

To make this Latin Lectionary and Sacred Scriptures into a useful
resource for the study of Ecclesiastical Latin.

Short-Term Goal
======================================================================

To publish static HTML versions of the Latin Lectionary and Sacred
Scriptures to the web.

Present Status
======================================================================

We are able to generate plain text formatted for the console.

Next Step
======================================================================

First, let's update the text formatters to generate an HTML front-end
for the web.

Other Ideas
======================================================================

After that, I have some ideas that can turn this static HTML into a
useful study tool:

* **Audio integration:** Being able to hear the text read aloud is
  quite important.

* **Dictionary integration:** When I encounter a new word, the first
  thing I want to do is to find it in a dictionary.

* **Track study words:** The first visit to a dictionary entry does
  not end my study of a word.  I want to remember that word so I can
  revisit the dictionary entry and study it in other ways too.

* **Visit other occurrences:** The very next way I want to study a
  word is to visit other occurrences of that same word in other
  contexts.

* **Perform exercises:** Understanding any word requires understanding
  its root meaning as well as the semantics conveyed by its form.  I
  would like tools (games?) to exercise this knowledge.

* **Quanitify the comprehension-value of a word:** When I encounter
  many new words, I would like to prioritize my study such that I
  study those words that open the most doors to comprehension *first*.

* **Quantify the total work, work done, and work remaining:** I think
  this would be motivating and even useful.

* **Generate reading-samples:** Having quantified my knowledge, I
  would like to generate real reading samples that reinforce, or
  slightly stretch my knowledge.
